*** [Deprecated] FDS: Face-Data-Server
It was a project to build server-client model avatar application.
FDS was the protocol for this project, but after I discovered [[https://protocol.vmc.info/][VirtualMotionCapture Protocol]],
I switched to it and archived most of this project.
Some repositories (e.g. ~faclig~) is actively developed since then with VMCP.

*** [Deprecated] Shgif: make ASCII ART Gif file.
Plays ASCII Art Gif recorded in simple text file.
